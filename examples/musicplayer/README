The file 'melody.csv' has been created using midicsv [1]. It can be played on a
Linux system using the following command:

	$ csvmidi melody.csv melody.mid && timidity melody.mid

The program "play.c" can be used to play the song on a Linux host using an
autogenerated EmbedVM script. The file "firmware.cc" contains an equivialent
program for an AVR microcontroller using the Arduino framework.

You need SPL [2] and aplay [3] to build and use "play.c".

You need SPL [2], the Arduino Framework [4] and arduino-cc.sh [5] to build and
run "firmware.cc". You'll also need an Arduino with a speaker connected to it's
pin 9.
