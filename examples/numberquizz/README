This is a simple demo application for EmbedVM using the
Arduino prototyping platform.

You need the Arduino IDE [1] and arduino-cc [2] in order
to build this application.

This program is not really using much of the AVR I/O
capabilities. It is only using the serial line (at 9600 baud)
to communicate with the user.
