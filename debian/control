Description: small embeddable virtual machine for microcontrollers
 EmbedVM is a virtual machine aimed at AVR microcontrollers (but portable to
 others). It comes with a C-like language frontend and a minimalistic Python
 compiler.
 .
 The VM architecture simulates a 16bit CPU which can access 64kB of memory,
 which contains the program code (bytecode), global data and the stack (for
 functions with up to 32 local variables and 32 arguments). Interaction with
 the platform is possible through callback ("user") functions or memory mapped
 hardware.
 .
 The machine itself takes about 3kB of program memory on AVR microcontrollers
 and can execute 75k instructions per second on a 16MHz clocked ATMega.
