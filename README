EmbedVM - Embedded Virtual Machine
==================================

EmbedVM is a small embeddable virtual machine for microcontrollers with a
C-like language frontend. It has been tested with GCC and AVR microcontrollers.
But as the Virtual machine is rather simple it should be easy to port it to
other architectures.

The file README.VM contains a brief description of the virtual machine.

The directory tools/ contains a C-like compiler for generating VM bytecode.
See tools/example.evm for a simple demo application.

The directory vmsrc/ contains the virtual machine itself and a simple demo
host application as reference for how to embedd the VM.

The directory examples/ contains example applications using EmbedVM.
